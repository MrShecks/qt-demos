# rgb-picker-demo-3

This is the fourth step in the rgb-picker-demo. It is based rgb-picker-demo-3
with some additional code demonstrating how we can connection signals from one or more ```QObjects``` (QWidgets) to
custom slots on our ```MainWindow``` class.

In the previous step we showed the different ways we and manually make signal/slot connections between UI widgets. But what if we want to do
something a little more complicated. In this example we are going to generate and display the HTML colour code based on the RGB values
selected by the user either via the QSlider or QSpinBox widgets.
