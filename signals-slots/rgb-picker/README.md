# rgb-picker-demo
This is just a parent ```"subdirs"``` project used to group the rgb-picker-demo-x child projects together.
It's just for convenience so can be ignored for the moment. Each of the demo projects is self contained and can be run individually.

The step-by-step examples for the RGB Picker Demo can be found in the following projects:-

- rgb-picker-demo-1
  Boiler plate ```QMainWindow``` based project as generated by Qt Creator but with additional comments

- rgb-picker-demo-2
  This project contains changes to start building the demo UI. There is no additional code from
  previous step, only the ```MainWindow.ui``` file has been modified via Qt Designer.

- rgb-picker-demo-2
  Continuing on with the steps to create our RGB Picker this project demonstrates the different methods
  that can be used to manually make connections between ```QObjects``` in code using the ```QObject::connect()``` method.
